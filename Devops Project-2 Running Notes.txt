Devops Project 2:

Tools whcih are used in this Project

Github
Maven
Jenkins
SonarQube
JFrog Artifactory
Promotheous Grafana
Kuernetes
Helm
Terraform 
Ansible



We are using Github for Source Code, Code will be pulled with the help of Jenkins, In Jenkins we have master and slave configuration slave will be used as a build node, in build node will install maven it builds the code, Once the code is built, we will run the SonarQube analysis if analysis is successful will commit our artifacts into our JFrog artifactory as a war or jar files as an artifactory.
We are going to deploy it as a micro service we are using docker with the help of docker we are going to create a docker image this docker images again stored into the JFrog artifactory, then we are deploying it into the K8S cluster or K8S environment with help of helm charts, This K8S environment or pods are monitored by the Prometheus and Grafana, in this project most of infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform and Configuration management is with Ansible. like Jenkins setup and slave system configuration, K8S deployment we are using Terraform


Overall setup is done on AWS.
